# Holy Unblocker (Old) Rewrite
This is a re-write of the original [Holy Unblocker](https://github.com/quiteafancyemerald/holy-unblocker) to be up-to-date. This means things like Wisp, Epoxy, Etc. are used instead of things like Corrosion, Etc. I did this because back in my skid days Holy Unblocker was my **favorite** webproxy and I want to continue to see the project live.

## Deployment
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/entrpix/holy-unblocker
$ cd holy-unblocker
$ npm i
$ npm start
# For SSL check-out https://github.com/entrpix/nginxssl
```

## TODO
- [X] Fix Server
- [X] Re-write HTML
- [X] Deobfuscate
- [ ] Fix Web-Proxies
- [ ] Fix Games
