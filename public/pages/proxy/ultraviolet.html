                    Focusing on speed UV works with YouTube, now.gg, Spotify, CoolMathGames and various .io sites!
                    <br>CAPTCHA is supported!
                    <br>Ultraviolet is highly recommended due to its speed and enhanced support for almost every site making it one of the most advanced web proxies.
                    <br>Sites with given support for logging in are Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, and Discord. YouTube allows for nearly full functionality.
                    <br>Discord support on Rammerhead is a KNOWN bug. It is being worked on.

                    Common Errors with Solutions:
                    <br>- Having issues with CAPTCHAs? It will take trial and error but try to go slow when it comes to solving them. CAPTCHA is a given but will take a few attempts.
                    <br>- Try using Classic mode or doing 'Reload Frame'. ("cdn.example.com" cannot be reached.)
                    <br>- You may not be able to login normally into a number of sites. Phone verification on a select number of sites may occur also with no real soluion.
